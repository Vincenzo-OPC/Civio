The rules are in spec §7 and §10. Never auto-approve or deploy. Batch 001-011 approval stays as Chief of Staff recorded it.

| Round | Date | Items / files | Pass | Fix | Fail | Report |

## Round 01

- **Issues:**
  - Spec metadata is missing on all 150: `terms` is empty, codes aren't in the spec, and `why_wrong` is generic.
  - 6 paragraph-order items give away their key.
  - 2 Filipino grammar errors in keys/stems (0026, 0038).
  - 1 item has two right answers (0046).
  - 1 Reveal doesn't match its key (0050).
  - GI has implausible distractors.
- **Decisions:** ChatGPT's files were left untouched, and their items stay draft. Gap fill 001 (23 drafts) was written for sawikain, human rights, RC, PO and ARMA filing.
- **Next:** round 02 = the Subprofessional parts of batches 001-011, in this order:
  1. clerical 151
  2. Verbal EN 200, sampled 100
  3. GI 102
  4. numerical, recompute-only

  Then round 03+ = the baseline bank (550), Subprofessional domains first. After that, gap fill 002: Verbal EN error recognition, numerical fractions and decimals, and ARMA business-name filing.

## Round 01 fixes and CoS verdict (2026-10-13)

- **CoS verdict:**
  - Gap-fill-001: 20 PASS. VFIL-0011, VFIL-0013 and VEN-RC-0017 needed code fixes, now done.
  - The 10 supplement FAILs are confirmed.
  - The other 140 supplement items pass on content and only needed metadata fixes.
- **Supplement fixes (every change is logged in `audit/round-01-fixes.md`):**
  - 10 FAILs fixed. VFIL-0075 to 0080 had their sentence labels shuffled, so no key equals the listed order.
  - Filled `terms` on all 150.
  - Spec codes on every distractor, and a separate why-wrong line for each option.
  - ARMA Rule 1 / ANSI/ARMA 12-2005 citation added to the 20 filing items.
  - GI giveaway distractors replaced in 0005, 0010, 0013, 0014, 0017, 0019, 0023, 0024, 0028 and 0029.
  - Spelling stems reworded and their wrong source label corrected.
  - "upang" is now the key in 3 completion items, down from 6.
  - Rescan for the new codes: 21 FIL-ANTONYM-TRAP and 9 RC-SUPPORTED-NOT-ASKED recodes. Batches 001-011 have no Filipino or RC items, so they had nothing to rescan.
- **Spec v0.1.5 (§10.4):** adds `FIL-ANTONYM-TRAP`, `RC-SUPPORTED-NOT-ASKED`, the order-key check, and the ANSI/ARMA 12-2005 note on filing Reveals.
- **qa.py:** rejects any order item whose key equals the listed order.
- **Activated:** only gap-fill-001 (23), set to approved/passed by Chief of Staff, 2026-10-13. The 150 supplement items stay draft/unreviewed.
- **Next:**
  - round 02: batches 001-011 Subprofessional parts (clerical, then Verbal English, GI, Numerical)
  - gap-fill 002: English error recognition, fractions and decimals, business-name filing

## Round 02 (2026-10-13)

- **Issues:**
  - About 25 typo-style misspellings, and the same misspelled words reused across batches.
  - Filing covers only ARMA Rules 1, 5 and 6, with one stem frame.
  - Frame repetition in Verbal (89 of 203 share one frame) and Numerical (30 share one frame).
  - 2 spelling Reveal labels describe the wrong error type.
- **Decisions:** the content of approved items is untouched; proposals went to CoS. I applied the §10.4 ARMA note to 58 filing items and re-rendered the batch `.md` files.
- **Gap fill 002:** 14 drafts written.
- **Next:**
  - round 03: baseline bank (550), Subprofessional domains first, starting with clerical and GI
  - CoS rulings on the round 02 proposals
  - gap fill 003: Filipino idioms and grammar beyond the supplements, and ARMA Rules 4 and 8

## Round 02 fixes (2026-10-13)

- **Gap-fill 002:** CoS PASS on all 14. I applied the 4 code and why-wrong fixes plus the optional VEN-ERROR-0003 recode. All 14 are approved and active in the local Civio DB.
- **Rulings applied (spec v0.1.6, §10.5):** these are rewrites of approved items, held in `docs/research/round-02-fixes.json` with status draft and review_status "changed". The batch files keep the approved versions.
  - 93 spelling items rewritten: unique real-misspelling targets, plus the new code SPL-SILENT. The 2 wrong error labels went away with the rewrite.
  - 60 Verbal lead-ins rewritten: "best completes" is down from 89 to 29.
  - 25 order-of-operations items rewritten across 5 new shapes, with keys recomputed.
  - The VFIL-0007 o2 recode to FIL-OTHER-TRAIT is applied in gap-fill-001 and synced.
- **Filing:** gap-fill-003 adds 10 drafts for ARMA Rules 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8.
- **Shortcut field (spec v0.1.7, §10.6):**
  - New optional `shortcut` field. `qa.py` accepts it, and the importer shows it as "Shortcut:", followed by "Method:".
  - 267 verified Numerical shortcuts are in `shortcuts-num-001.json`, pending CoS.
- **qa.py additions:**
  - one spelling target per item, bank-wide
  - error codes must match the misspelling
  - the 25% frame cap
  - exact evaluation of brackets and ÷
  - `qa_all.py` overlays `round-*-fixes.json`; it is GREEN with the overlay and RED with `--no-fixes`, as expected.
- **Next:**
  - CoS verdict on the 178 rewrites, gap-fill-003, and the shortcuts. Then merge the rewrites into the batches, retire the old-stem DB rows (the importer keys on stem), and sync.
  - Round 03: baseline bank (550), Subprofessional first.
  - Shortcut backfill for Clerical, Verbal and GI.

| ChatGPT 001 | 2026-10-13 | `chatgpt-batch-001.json`: 100 original Filipino Verbal drafts (synonym 25, antonym 20, sawikain 15, grammar 15, reading 15, paragraph ordering 10) | 0 approved; 100 unreviewed | independent content and linguistic review pending | 0 structural blockers in connector checks | `chatgpt-batch-001.json` |

## ChatGPT batch 001 (2026-10-13)

- New file: `docs/research/chatgpt-batch-001.json`, **100 draft / unreviewed Filipino Verbal items**. Breakdown: 25 synonym, 20 antonym, 15 idiom/sawikain, 15 grammar, 15 reading comprehension, 10 paragraph-order questions.
- Static checks: 4 distinct options each, answer-option references, item metadata, spec distractor codes, choice-specific `why_wrong`, ordering-code distinctness, nontrivial order keys and locally unique IDs/stems. Token Jaccard at threshold **0.65** found no matches against **1,197** existing bank/supplement/gap-fill questions and **127** available baseline seed/prefix stems. This is not a comparison against all 550 rows in the private local development DB.
- **Validation limitation:** The actual Python `scripts/batches/qa.py` was not executable in this connector-only environment. The equivalent structural and token-duplicate checks were run, but the new JSON MUST pass the repository's Python QA and independent review before import or approval. No app code, tests, Grok batches or deploy were changed.
- Review focus: `CIVIO-VFIL-KASINGKAHULUGAN-040009` (mabini), `CIVIO-VFIL-KASINGKAHULUGAN-040013` (kinauukulang), `CIVIO-VFIL-WIKAIN-040054` (assess whether the idiom is suitably standard, and review all idioms), grammar items `CIVIO-VFIL-BALARILA-040069`/`040070` (din/rin, daw/raw; compare DepEd/KWF *Ortograpiyang Pambansa* §8.1) and all 10 ordering items for unique defensibility. Review interpretation and tone as natural Filipino and verify dictionary spelling. Review `RC-TOO-NARROW` choices for code precision. 
- Never auto-approve, activate or deploy. Reviewers: Grok Bot → Chief of Staff.
