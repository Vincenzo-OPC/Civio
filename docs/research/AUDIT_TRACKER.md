# Civio audit tracker (single source of progress)

The rules are in spec §7 and §10. Never auto-approve or deploy. Batch 001-011 approval stays as Chief of Staff recorded it.

| Round | Date | Items / files | Pass | Fix | Fail | Report |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | 2026-10-13 | ChatGPT supplements 001: 150 (VFIL 80, GI 30, CLR 40) | 0 release-ready (140 content-pass) | 140 | 10 | audit/round-01.md |

## Round 01

- **Issues:**
  - Spec metadata is missing on all 150: `terms` is empty, codes aren't in the spec, and `why_wrong` is generic.
  - 6 paragraph-order items give away their key.
  - 2 Filipino grammar errors in keys/stems (0026, 0038).
  - 1 item has two right answers (0046).
  - 1 Reveal doesn't match its key (0050).
  - GI has implausible distractors.
- **Decisions:** ChatGPT's files were left untouched, and their items stay draft. Gap fill 001 (23 drafts) was written for sawikain, human rights, RC, PO and ARMA filing.
- **Next:** round 02 = the Subprofessional parts of batches 001-011, in this order:
  1. clerical 151
  2. Verbal EN 200, sampled 100
  3. GI 102
  4. numerical, recompute-only

  Then round 03+ = the baseline bank (550), Subprofessional domains first. After that, gap fill 002: Verbal EN error recognition, numerical fractions and decimals, and ARMA business-name filing.
